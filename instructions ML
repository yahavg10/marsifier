Quick notes & how to use
	•	Start Mongo with collections:
	•	operations_log documents should include at least {"project": str, "operation": "add|delete|update", "timestamp": datetime, "project_size": int}.
	•	projects documents can include {"project": str, "destinations": [...]} to compute project size.
	•	Place pre-trained models in MODEL_DIR:
	•	anomaly.joblib — trained IsolationForest compatible with the feature vector [hour,weekday,project_size,adds,deletes,updates]
	•	nextop.joblib — trained classifier predicting operation labels from same vector
	•	If models are missing, the service trains quick fallback models from existing operations_log.
	•	Call with POST /analyze and your payload (example):
{
  "project": "ptl100",
  "change_no_1":"Added destinations: [dest2, dest3]",
  "change_no_2":"Deleted dests: [dest1]",
  "change_no_3":"Updates dests: [dest0]"
}
{
  "project": "ptl100",
  "overall_behavior_score": 0.83,
  "analysis": {
    "intensity": "High activity in a short time window — suggests a restructuring phase.",
    "risk": "Low operational risk. Mix of additions and removals appears intentional and consistent with past behavior.",
    "pattern_similarity": "This update resembles 14 past change events from this project involving multi-destination adjustments.",
    "anomalies": "No unusual patterns detected. Delete/update frequency is within historical norms.",
    "forecast": "Expected follow-up changes in the next 24–48 hours based on previous behavior sequences.",
    "human_summary": "The project is undergoing a coordinated update: destinations are being reorganized in a way that matches previous structured maintenance cycles. Nothing appears urgent or risky."
  },
  "per_change_interpretation": {
    "Change No.1": "Adding dest2 and dest3 fits the historical pattern of expanding output routes.",
    "Change No.2": "Deleting dest1 continues a trend where legacy or low-traffic destinations are removed.",
    "Change No.3": "Updating dest0 aligns with recurring adjustments the project typically performs after adding new destinations."
  }
}
Response contains a human-friendly explanation plus pluggable ML outputs.
