Quick notes & how to use
	•	Start Mongo with collections:
	•	operations_log documents should include at least {"project": str, "operation": "add|delete|update", "timestamp": datetime, "project_size": int}.
	•	projects documents can include {"project": str, "destinations": [...]} to compute project size.
	•	Place pre-trained models in MODEL_DIR:
	•	anomaly.joblib — trained IsolationForest compatible with the feature vector [hour,weekday,project_size,adds,deletes,updates]
	•	nextop.joblib — trained classifier predicting operation labels from same vector
	•	If models are missing, the service trains quick fallback models from existing operations_log.
	•	Call with POST /analyze and your payload (example):
{
  "project": "ptl100",
  "change_no_1":"Added destinations: [dest2, dest3]",
  "change_no_2":"Deleted dests: [dest1]",
  "change_no_3":"Updates dests: [dest0]"
}
